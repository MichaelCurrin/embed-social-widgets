# FB Plugin Test

This site uses a page plugin supported by Facebook Dev site to pull in details such as profile image, timeline and events.
- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/

The plugin page allows easy customization and a preview, then gives you snippets to paste on your site. See code at [index.html](/index.html) and [iframe.html](/iframe.html).

This is also a test of Netlify CORS configs. See [netlify.toml](/netlify.toml).
