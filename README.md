# Embed social widget
> Showcase of embedding the Facebook plugin and an Instagram post


## Installation

Install _Jekyll_ globally.


## Run

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```


## Notes

This shows a live example of using a FB page plugin to pull in details such as profile image, timeline and events. The plugin snippet is created using a tool of Facebook's Developer site.

- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/

The plugin page allows easy customization and a preview, then gives you snippets to paste on your site. See code at [index.html](/index.html) and [iframe.html](/iframe.html).

This is also a test of Netlify CORS configs. See [netlify.toml](/netlify.toml).
