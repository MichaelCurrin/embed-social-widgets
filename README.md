# FB Plugin Test
> Showcase of using FB's plugin to pull in FB page details onto a Netlify website

## Notes

This shows a live example of using a FB page plugin to pull in details such as profile image, timeline and events. The plugin snippet is created using a tool of Facebook's Developer site.
- https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/page-plugin/

The plugin page allows easy customization and a preview, then gives you snippets to paste on your site. See code at [index.html](/index.html) and [iframe.html](/iframe.html).

This is also a test of Netlify CORS configs. See [netlify.toml](/netlify.toml).
